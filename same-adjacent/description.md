Write a function `'same_adjacent(str, char)'` that takes in a string and a single character. Return the number of times that the single character appears in the string, but only if it appears next to itself.

For example: 
- If the string is `"hello"` and the character is `"l"`, `same_adjacent("hello", "l")` should return you `2`.
- If the string is `"test"` and the character is `"t"`, `same_adjacent("test", "t")` should return you `0`.
- If the string is `"aabbaa"` and the character is `"a"`, `same_adjacent("aabbaa", "a")` should return you `4`.
